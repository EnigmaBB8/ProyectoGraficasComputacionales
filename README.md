## Idea

The idea of the following project is about showing the Earth in a 3D scene, and other planets that I invented. These planets can be seen while you move the cursor backwards, you can also see the planets and move them on their axis of rotation. The planets have their own rotation. The following resources were used in the development of this project

## Resources

## WEBGL

WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a standard specification that defines an API implemented in JavaScript for rendering 3D graphics within any web browser. To include it in the project, the following line of code was made in the index.html file.
```
<canvas class="webgl"></canvas>
```
And in the client.js file
```
const canvas = document.querySelector('.webgl');
```
