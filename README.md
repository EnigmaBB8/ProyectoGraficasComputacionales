# Computer Graphics Project

The following project of the subject of computer graphics where various knowledge of programming, linear algebra, design, among others, will present the scenario of a planet Earth with a different design than what we are used to.

Throughout this file, the resources that were used will be documented to transmit to those who seek similar information.

## INSPIRATION

## ARCHITECTURE

For this project, the client-server model or architecture will be used.Client-server architecture is a computing model in which the server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client. This type of architecture has one or more client computers connected to a central server over a network or internet connection. 

## WEBGL

WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering **high-performance** interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. WebGL does so by introducing an API that closely conforms to OpenGL ES 2.0 that can be used in HTML5 <canvas> elements. This conformance makes it possible for the API to take advantage of hardware graphics acceleration provided by the user's device.

## THREE.JS

Three.js is a lightweight library written in JavaScript for creating and displaying **animated 3D computer** graphics in a Web browser and can be used in conjunction with the HTML5, SVG, or WebGL canvas element.
