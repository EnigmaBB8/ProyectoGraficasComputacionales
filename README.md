# Computer Graphics Project

The following project of the subject of computer graphics where various knowledge of programming, linear algebra, design, among others, will present the scenario of a planet Earth with a different design than what we are used to.

Throughout this file, the resources that were used will be documented to transmit to those who seek similar information.

## WEBGL

WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering **high-performance** interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. WebGL does so by introducing an API that closely conforms to OpenGL ES 2.0 that can be used in HTML5 <canvas> elements. This conformance makes it possible for the API to take advantage of hardware graphics acceleration provided by the user's device.

## THREE.JS

Three.js is a lightweight library written in JavaScript for creating and displaying animated 3D computer graphics in a Web browser and can be used in conjunction with the HTML5, SVG, or WebGL canvas element.
